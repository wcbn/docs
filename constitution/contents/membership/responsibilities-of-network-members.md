# Responsibilities of Network Members

As active participants in their own broadcasting education, all Network Members bear the responsibility of keeping informed about matters concerning the Network. They shall maintain a knowledge and observance of policies and procedures as they apply to the Campus Broadcasting Network, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Communications Commission. This includes an awareness of electoral and fiscal procedures, ethical advertising and business practices, and community standards of good taste in broadcasting. Network Members shall maintain an active relationship with the Executive Director\(s\) of the department\(s\) they are involved in.

Since a large number of Network Members share a limited amount of resources, all due care shall be taken to see that Network equipment and facilities are used safely and properly, and are left secure and clean. Information, training, and operational procedures shall not be held from any Network Member or potential Network Member for any reason.
