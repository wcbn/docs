# Network Members

After the apprenticeship period, volunteers are considered to be full members of the Network. They shall retain their membership status as long as they remain actively involved at the Network. If a person is absent from the Network for more than one full year, they must re-enter the Network with apprentice status.

There are four different types of membership: student members, alumni members, faculty/staff members, and community members, collectively referred to as "Network members" throughout this document. Since alumni members, faculty/staff members, and community members are not students, they are collectively referred to as "non-student members."

Student members are required to be students at one of the campuses of the University of Michigan. A student is defined as any person either currently enrolled at the University of Michigan, or having been enrolled for a full term during the last term of the University. Student members hold the right to vote in all Network elections, including elections for all Board of Directors seats and constitutional changes.

Alumni members are alumni of the University of Michigan. An alumnus is defined as any person who was formerly enrolled at the University of Michigan at any time in his or her life. Alumni members hold the right to vote for the alumni seat on the Board of Directors. They are not permitted to vote for other Board of Directors seats or on constitutional changes.

Faculty/staff members are individuals who currently hold a 50% or greater regular \(not temporary\) appointment at the University of Michigan. Faculty/staff members hold the right to vote for the faculty/staff seat on the Board of Directors. They are not permitted to vote for other Board of Directors seats or on constitutional changes.

Community members are individuals with no formal affiliation with the University of Michigan. They represent the community at large. They hold no formal voting rights and are not eligible to run for any Board of Directors seats.

Persons who simultaneously qualify as an alumni member and as a faculty/staff member hold the right to vote for both the alumni Board of Directors seat and the faculty/staff Board of Directors seat. Persons who simultaneously qualify as a student member and as a faculty/staff member shall be considered student members.

The type of membership that each Network Member holds shall be re-evaluated each semester, as it is likely to change.
