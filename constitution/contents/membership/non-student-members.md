# Non-student Members

Charged as it is with providing a valuable and important service to both the University community and the public at large, the involvement of a wider community is essential to the proper functioning of the Network. Student members shall in all cases receive priority consideration over non-student members in the normal function of a Network department. Non-student members will participate in many instances as working personnel in an advisory or resource capacity. More information regarding appropriate roles for non-student members can be found in the Bylaws.
