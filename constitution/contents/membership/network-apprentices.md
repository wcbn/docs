# Network Apprentices

When an individual first becomes actively involved at the Network, this person is considered to be a apprentice. In order to move from apprentice status to member status, he or she must complete required training. \`\`Actively involved'' varies from department to department, as the responsibilities of each department differ. It is therefore defined by the Executive Director of each department, using the Bylaws of this Constitution as a reference. Each Executive Director is expected to maintain a record of when their volunteers became actively involved with the Network.
