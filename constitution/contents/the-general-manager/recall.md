# Recall

If an individual Board Member feels that the General Manager has been remiss in his/her duties, s/he may propose a motion to recall the General Manager. In order to recall the General Manager, the Board of Directors shall schedule a public hearing. At the hearing, a special chairperson \(who shall retain voting rights\) shall be chosen from among the voting Board Members. All parties shall be given ample time to represent their cases and are entitled to cross examine. Removal of the General Manager shall require the approval of three quarters of all voting Board Members. If the General Manager is successfully recalled, an Acting General Manager shall be elected by majority vote of the Board. The first duty of the Acting General Manager shall be to initiate the election process for a new General Manager. A General Manager who is recalled may not petition for that office, but may run for the Board of Directors and hold other Network positions.
