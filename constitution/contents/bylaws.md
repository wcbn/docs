# Bylaws

### Introduction

These are the Bylaws of the Campus Broadcasting Network, and are specific rules of the policy and conduct for all participants at the Network. All staff members and Executive Staff will conduct themselves in accordance with these and other guidelines recorded in the Network Manual. No Network Member shall waive or modify the Rules, Bylaws, Job Descriptions, or other documents without due and proper consultation and approval of appropriate Network officials and the Board of Directors.

### Enacting Bylaws

These bylaws may be passed, modified, or rescinded by the Board of Directors at any meeting following public posting of the proposed changes or additions for at least seven days before the meeting. A simple majority of Board Members present is required to enact any changes. The Board of Directors may not act on any changes until they have been posted for at least seven days.

### Telephone Use

No staff member shall use the telephone at the Network for personal reasons, with the exception of local emergency calls. In addition, no Network Member shall make personal use of the Network's facsimile, or cause the Network to be billed as a third party for any phone call.

### Purchasing Procedures

All Network Members will conduct purchasing in accordance with Constitutional requirements and Network rules, and take full responsibility for improper purchases. Authorization for expenditures must be obtained from the appropriate Executive Director and then the General Manager. Expenditures in excess of $400.00 will additionally require approval by the Board of Directors. Purchasers are also responsible for seeing that the date and exact nature of the purchase are duly recorded by the Budget Director.

### Key Policy

Only persons who have a continuing Network-related need to enter locked areas of the Network will be given keys. All door keys must be obtained through the General Manager, via the Key Office, and returned to the Key Office as soon as they are no longer needed. Persons no longer needing a key for the purpose it was originally obtained must return the key. The General Manager will conduct a key review before the end of each school year to determine continued eligibility for possession of keys. Persons found in possession of unauthorized or illegitimately obtained key\(s\) will be suspended from the Network, pending investigation. Illegitimately obtained key\(s\) will be confiscated.

### Disciplinary Actions

Persons who violate Network Bylaws, Constitutional or Departmental regulations are subject to suspension or expulsion from their Department and/or Network privileges. Suspensions may be of varying length, depending on the severity of the violation. The authority for suspension and expulsion rests solely with the General Manager who is required in each case to inform the Board of Directors.

### Annual Report

The General Manager shall circulate an annual report at the end of each elected term to all relevant University officials, the Board of Directors, and Network Executive Directors, regarding the accomplishments and current status of the Network.

### Non-Student Members

Responsibility for ensuring that non-students have a limited advisory role \(as outlined in Article 4\) lies with Executive Directors who oversee individual departments, but ultimately must be enforced by the Board of Directors in concert with the General Manager. Specifically, the General Manager is required to request a formal report from each Executive Director in the middle of the Fall and Winter terms. These reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors. The Executive Directors shall check with the University Registrar on the student status of every individual in their respective departments. The General Manager shall keep a record of such reports. Finally, it is the province of both the General Manager and the Board of Directors to determine whether a non-student is serving the function put forth in this policy. The General Manager may overrule an Executive Director on such a decision, and the Board of Directors may in turn override the General Manager.

Any Network Member \(or any other person, including the Board of Directors\) may request a review of a specific non-student's position and function at the Network, which shall be conducted by the General Manager \(who shall inform the Board\). In the case of the dissatisfaction of any individual, the inquiry may be reviewed by the Board of Directors. In all cases, care shall be taken to treat all parties involved with the utmost respect, since all persons at the Network are volunteers of their time and effort whose ultimate concern is assumed to be the well-being of the Network and the communities it serves.

Each of WCBN's dedicated community advisors brings his or her unique expertise and generously donates time to educate and train our student volunteers. Our community advisors are experts in little-known genres of music, such as 1920's jazz, Indian classical, rockabilly, 20th century experimental, Jamaican dancehall music, etc.; or have extensive experience writing press releases or music reviews for newspapers and music guides, producing live bands or recorded announcements for radio play, administrating internet servers, etc.; or use their connections to arrange on-air ticket giveaways, interviews with locally or nationally famous musicians and authors, performances at our recruitment and awareness events and concerts, etc. Non-students who are seeking to join WCBN must justify their applications and explain in what ways they will contribute to the education of student volunteers. In all cases, the primary responsibility of non-student volunteers of WCBN is to enhance the engaged learning of our student membership: in accordance with our constitution, student members receive priority over non-student advisors in the normal function of a network department.

### Conflict of Interest

Reporting of outside employment and business interests shall be a requirement of all on-air activity and it shall be the respective Program Directors' duty to inform persons with a potential conflict of interest of pertinent FCC regulation concerning this matter.

### Guest Policy

Network Members will be allowed to bring no more than 3 guests at one time to the station facilities. While these guests are in CBN facilities, the member escorting them will be responsible for any misconduct of these guests which damages station property.

The maximum number of guests allowed may be waived if it is for the purpose of an on-air performance. Permission for this special circumstance must be obtained from the General Manager \(or appropriate executive staff member\) prior to the performance.

### Publicity

All publicity postings regarding the station are subject to approval by the General Manager and/or the Executive Staff.

### Active Involvement

The term "actively involved" is used throughout this Constitution to refer to a certain level of involvement and commitment by Network volunteers to the department that they are involved in. The Executive Director of each department shall determine the level of participation in his or her department that represents "active involvement," and is responsible for communicating this to all Network Members and Apprentices.

### Examples of Active Involvement:

* An apprentice in the Programming Department creating and handing in his/her demo tape, and actively pursuing the completion of his/her training.
* A newscaster creating or broadcasting news stories on a weekly basis.
* Regularly attending Executive Staff or Music Review meetings.

### Elections and Terms of the Board

The student, faculty/staff, and alumni Members of the Board are elected by general election of Network Members. Each term length is one year. Two student Members and the faculty/staff member shall be elected each November, to take office at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Three student Members and the alumnus member shall be elected each April, to take office at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Representatives from the two Vice Presidential offices shall be appointed by formal notification to the General Manager.

### Member Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, any conduct and communications taking place within WCBN \(e.g. in-person communication, email exchange, and discussions over the Radio Free Ann Arbor listserv\) between members should be done in a respectful fashion. WCBN does not tolerate bullying, harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks in any form. All station members and groups, regardless of role or status, shall receive the same level of respect.

#### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
