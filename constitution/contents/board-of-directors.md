# Board of Directors

### Composition

The Campus Broadcasting Network Board of Directors shall be composed of nine voting Members consisting of five students, one University of Michigan Alumnus, one University of Michigan Faculty or Staff member, one representative of the Office of the Vice President for University Relations and one representative of the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. The General Manager is an ex officio member of the Board without vote, and shall chair meetings of the Board.

### Dates and Terms

The student, faculty/staff, and alumnus Members of the Board are elected by general election of Network Members. Election cycles and details are found in the By-Laws. Representatives from the two Vice Presidential offices shall be appointed by formal notification to the General Manager.

### Petitioning, Qualifying

Network Members seeking election to the Board of Directors must present a written petition to the General Manager stating their candidacy. Any Network Member may approach an alumnus or faculty/staff member concerning candidacy, but a formal petition must be written by the candidate. All petitions should state the candidate's experience and qualifications, goals and reasons for seeking Board membership, and any other relevant information. Candidates must have been Network Members for at least three months prior to the date on which they would take office if elected. Eligibility to petition is determined by the General Manager. Any Member denied candidacy may appeal the General Manager's decision to the Board of Directors.

### Schedule

The date of commencement of the Board of Director elections shall be announced one month in advance of said date. The final date that petitions will be accepted will be one week prior to the commencement of the election. Qualified candidates petitioning past the deadline shall be allowed to post their petitions in a designated place within the Network but will not appear on the ballots. Candidates petitioning late may be elected by write-in.

### Balloting

Election balloting shall be open for a period not less than seven nor more than fourteen calendar days. All student Network Members at the time of election shall be eligible to vote for all Board seats. Student Network Members may cast as many votes as there are open seats with at most one vote going to each candidate. Alumni Network Members shall be eligible to vote for the Alumni seat. Faculty/staff Network Members shall be eligible to vote for the Faculty/staff seat. Each Network Member may cast only one ballot. Space shall be provided on the ballot for write-in candidates. It is not necessary for a candidate to receive a majority to be elected. The candidate receiving the most votes shall be declared elected. If there is more than one open seat, the candidate receiving the second most votes shall be elected also. If there are more than two open seats, the above procedure is to be iterated until all seats are full. Ties shall be decided by a special election. No Network Member shall be denied the opportunity to vote, provided the request is made within the time of the election. The General Manager shall see to it that all Network Members are made aware of the election.

### Special Elections

Special elections for Board of Directors seats open as a result of resignation, forfeiture of seat, or other reasons, shall be accomplished as outlined in Section 3, 4, and 5 above. Candidates elected to fill such seats shall serve until the expiration of the current term of that seat, and are then free to petition for election again. Elections concerning other issues, or to decide a tie vote in a regular election, shall be conducted at the General Manager's discretion, with the Board of Directors to be advised of the procedures.

### Authority

The Board of Directors has the authority to enact policies, directives, and bylaws for the Network. The Board oversee the activities of the General Manager and the Executive Directors, in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.

### Appeals

The Board of Directors shall sit as an appeals body for any dispute arising within the Network. Any Network Member may approach the Board with an appeal. The General Manager shall have the right to hear the appeal first. The Board may refuse to hear an appeal which has not been previously reviewed by the General Manager. The Board of Directors is the final arbiter of this Constitution. Appeals decisions rendered by the Board shall be considered final, but the Board may subsequently revisit its decision at its discretion.

### Quorum

A quorum of five of the nine total voting members shall be present in order to conduct business at a Board of Directors meeting. A majority of those members present are sufficient to pass most motions. The exceptions to this rule are as follows: Five affirmative votes shall be required to elect the General Manager. Seven affirmative votes shall be required to recall the General Manager and to approve an amendment to the constitution.

### Procedure

The General Manager, as an ex officio member of the Board of Directors, shall chair Board of Directors meetings. The General Manager shall call meetings of the Board as determined by the Board Members at the start of each academic semester. The General Manager shall be without vote, even in the case of a tie, which shall have the effect of the motion failing. Board meetings shall be conducted in accordance with Parliamentary procedures as outlined in \`\`Roberts Rules of Order,'' unless superseded by this Constitution. The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, conduct an anonymous paper vote. The General Manager may not simultaneously hold the position of General Manager and sit on the Board of Directors.

### Absences

If any Board Member, save for the Vice Presidents' representatives, shall neglect to attend two consecutive regularly scheduled meetings without prior notification to the General Manager, s/he will automatically have vacated his/her seat. This vacancy will be filled at the discretion of the Board of Directors, according to the election procedures outlined previously. If the General Manager is unable to attend a scheduled Board meeting, the Board may select its own chairperson from among themselves, with said chairperson to retain his/her eligibility to vote.

### Budget

The Board of Directors shall give final approval to the budget by which the Network shall be operated for each fiscal year. All transactions must be approved in advance by the General Manager. Any single transaction greater than the amount specified in the bylaws of this Constitution must have explicit Board approval, unless the General Manager determines that the expenditure is an emergency one which must be made before the next Board meeting. The Board may, by suitable action, define the conditions that satisfy this emergency requirement.

### Ex Officio Membership

The Executive Directors and the Chief Engineer of the Campus Broadcasting Network are ex officio members of the Board of Directors. Although they have no vote, they are encouraged to attend all Board of Directors meetings and submit department reports.

### Special Meeting

Special or emergency meetings may be called by the General Manager or by any other member of the Board. Such meetings shall be conducted according to the previously outlined procedure.

### Recall

If a Board Member feels that an elected Board Member is remiss in his/her duties, he/she may propose a motion to remove this person from the Board. In order to remove this person from the Board, the remainder of the Board shall conduct a public hearing. All parties shall be given ample time to present their cases, and are entitled to cross examine. Removal of elected Board Members shall require three-quarters approval by the remaining Board of Directors. If a Board Member is successfully recalled, the Board may fill the vacated seat at their discretion, and in accordance with the election procedure outlined previously.

If a Board Member feels that an appointed Board Member is remiss in his/her duties, he/she may propose a motion to petition to remove this person from the Board. If three-quarters of the Board is in agreement that this person needs to be replaced, the General Manager will write a petition to the appropriate Office of the Vice President. This petition shall contain the reasons for this action and will contain the signatures of all Board Members that voted to remove this person.
