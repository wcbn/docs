# Introduction

WCBN enhances engaged learning for its student volunteers through music and public affairs broadcasting, content development, and event production. We develop studentsâ€™ skills in management, fundraising, communication, technology, digital media, teamwork, web design, and research. We continuously work to enrich the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor communities. This Constitution is valid and binding upon the approval of three-quarters of the total membership of the Network Board of Directors and two-thirds of the Network Members voting in a ratification election.
