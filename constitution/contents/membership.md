# Membership

### Network Apprentices

When an individual first becomes actively involved at the Network, this person is considered to be a apprentice. In order to move from apprentice status to member status, he or she must complete required training. \`\`Actively involved'' varies from department to department, as the responsibilities of each department differ. It is therefore defined by the Executive Director of each department, using the Bylaws of this Constitution as a reference. Each Executive Director is expected to maintain a record of when their volunteers became actively involved with the Network.

### Network Members

After the apprenticeship period, volunteers are considered to be full members of the Network. They shall retain their membership status as long as they remain actively involved at the Network. If a person is absent from the Network for more than one full year, they must re-enter the Network with apprentice status.

There are four different types of membership: student members, alumni members, faculty/staff members, and community members, collectively referred to as "Network members" throughout this document. Since alumni members, faculty/staff members, and community members are not students, they are collectively referred to as "non-student members."

Student members are required to be students at one of the campuses of the University of Michigan. A student is defined as any person either currently enrolled at the University of Michigan, or having been enrolled for a full term during the last term of the University. Student members hold the right to vote in all Network elections, including elections for all Board of Directors seats and constitutional changes.

Alumni members are alumni of the University of Michigan. An alumnus is defined as any person who was formerly enrolled at the University of Michigan at any time in his or her life. Alumni members hold the right to vote for the alumni seat on the Board of Directors. They are not permitted to vote for other Board of Directors seats or on constitutional changes.

Faculty/staff members are individuals who currently hold a 50% or greater regular \(not temporary\) appointment at the University of Michigan. Faculty/staff members hold the right to vote for the faculty/staff seat on the Board of Directors. They are not permitted to vote for other Board of Directors seats or on constitutional changes.

Community members are individuals with no formal affiliation with the University of Michigan. They represent the community at large. They hold no formal voting rights and are not eligible to run for any Board of Directors seats.

Persons who simultaneously qualify as an alumni member and as a faculty/staff member hold the right to vote for both the alumni Board of Directors seat and the faculty/staff Board of Directors seat. Persons who simultaneously qualify as a student member and as a faculty/staff member shall be considered student members.

The type of membership that each Network Member holds shall be re-evaluated each semester, as it is likely to change.

### Non-student Members

Charged as it is with providing a valuable and important service to both the University community and the public at large, the involvement of a wider community is essential to the proper functioning of the Network. Student members shall in all cases receive priority consideration over non-student members in the normal function of a Network department. Non-student members will participate in many instances as working personnel in an advisory or resource capacity. More information regarding appropriate roles for non-student members can be found in the Bylaws.

### Responsibilities of Network Members

As active participants in their own broadcasting education, all Network Members bear the responsibility of keeping informed about matters concerning the Network. They shall maintain a knowledge and observance of policies and procedures as they apply to the Campus Broadcasting Network, the University of Michigan, and the Federal Communications Commission. This includes an awareness of electoral and fiscal procedures, ethical advertising and business practices, and community standards of good taste in broadcasting. Network Members shall maintain an active relationship with the Executive Director\(s\) of the department\(s\) they are involved in.

Since a large number of Network Members share a limited amount of resources, all due care shall be taken to see that Network equipment and facilities are used safely and properly, and are left secure and clean. Information, training, and operational procedures shall not be held from any Network Member or potential Network Member for any reason.

### Non-Discrimination

It is the policy of the University of Michigan and the Campus Broadcasting Network that no person, on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, marital status, handicap, Vietnam-era status or sexual orientation, shall be discriminated against in employment, educational programs and activities, or admissions.
