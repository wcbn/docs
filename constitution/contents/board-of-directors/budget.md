# Budget

The Board of Directors shall give final approval to the budget by which the Network shall be operated for each fiscal year. All transactions must be approved in advance by the General Manager. Any single transaction greater than the amount specified in the bylaws of this Constitution must have explicit Board approval, unless the General Manager determines that the expenditure is an emergency one which must be made before the next Board meeting. The Board may, by suitable action, define the conditions that satisfy this emergency requirement.
