# Absences

If any Board Member, save for the Vice Presidents' representatives, shall neglect to attend two consecutive regularly scheduled meetings without prior notification to the General Manager, s/he will automatically have vacated his/her seat. This vacancy will be filled at the discretion of the Board of Directors, according to the election procedures outlined previously. If the General Manager is unable to attend a scheduled Board meeting, the Board may select its own chairperson from among themselves, with said chairperson to retain his/her eligibility to vote.
