# Petitioning, Qualifying

Network Members seeking election to the Board of Directors must present a written petition to the General Manager stating their candidacy. Any Network Member may approach an alumnus or faculty/staff member concerning candidacy, but a formal petition must be written by the candidate. All petitions should state the candidate's experience and qualifications, goals and reasons for seeking Board membership, and any other relevant information. Candidates must have been Network Members for at least three months prior to the date on which they would take office if elected. Eligibility to petition is determined by the General Manager. Any Member denied candidacy may appeal the General Manager's decision to the Board of Directors.
