# Purchasing Procedures

All Network Members will conduct purchasing in accordance with Constitutional requirements and Network rules, and take full responsibility for improper purchases. Authorization for expenditures must be obtained from the appropriate Executive Director and then the General Manager. Expenditures in excess of $400.00 will additionally require approval by the Board of Directors. Purchasers are also responsible for seeing that the date and exact nature of the purchase are duly recorded by the Budget Director.
