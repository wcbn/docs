# Active Involvement

The term "actively involved" is used throughout this Constitution to refer to a certain level of involvement and commitment by Network volunteers to the department that they are involved in. The Executive Director of each department shall determine the level of participation in his or her department that represents "active involvement," and is responsible for communicating this to all Network Members and Apprentices.

### Examples of Active Involvement:

* A newscaster creating or broadcasting news stories on a weekly basis.
* Regularly attending Executive Staff or Music Review meetings.
