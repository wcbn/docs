# Key Policy

Only persons who have a continuing Network-related need to enter locked areas of the Network will be given keys. All door keys must be obtained through the General Manager, via the Key Office, and returned to the Key Office as soon as they are no longer needed. Persons no longer needing a key for the purpose it was originally obtained must return the key. The General Manager will conduct a key review before the end of each school year to determine continued eligibility for possession of keys. Persons found in possession of unauthorized or illegitimately obtained key\(s\) will be suspended from the Network, pending investigation. Illegitimately obtained key\(s\) will be confiscated.
