# Guest Policy

Network Members will be allowed to bring no more than 3 guests at one time to the station facilities. While these guests are in CBN facilities, the member escorting them will be responsible for any misconduct of these guests which damages station property.

The maximum number of guests allowed may be waived if it is for the purpose of an on-air performance. Permission for this special circumstance must be obtained from the General Manager \(or appropriate executive staff member\) prior to the performance.
