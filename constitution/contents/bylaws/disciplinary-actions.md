# Disciplinary Actions

Persons who violate Network Bylaws, Constitutional or Departmental regulations are subject to suspension or expulsion from their Department and/or Network privileges. Suspensions may be of varying length, depending on the severity of the violation. The authority for suspension and expulsion rests solely with the General Manager who is required in each case to inform the Board of Directors.
